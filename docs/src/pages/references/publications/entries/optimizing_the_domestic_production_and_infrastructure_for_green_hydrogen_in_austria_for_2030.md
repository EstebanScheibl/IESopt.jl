_**Abstract --**_ The decarbonisation of the Austrian energy system is expected to be facilitated by the uptake of hydrogen-based technologies, which requires the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure to meet the rising demand. While large quantities of hydrogen are expected to be imported in the future, current developments in the energy market suggest that domestic production of hydrogen should not be ignored to ensure the security of supply. As domestic production ramps up, locating electrolysers to ensure optimal system integration is still an open question. To address this challenge, the "HyTechonomy" project developed an optimisation model that identifies the most promising domestic locations for green hydrogen production and optimal means of hydrogen transport for the year 2030.
