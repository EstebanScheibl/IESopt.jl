parameters:
  - default       # You can leave out the extension, which will be automatically added
  - demand        # Adding this will inject parameters in `demand` after those loaded from `default`
  # - high_demand

# Note: Enableing `high_demand` would attempt to override the `demand` parameter, that is already contained in the
# `demand` parameter file. This would result in an error. If you are sure you want to allow overrides, you can activate
# that below in the general config section.
