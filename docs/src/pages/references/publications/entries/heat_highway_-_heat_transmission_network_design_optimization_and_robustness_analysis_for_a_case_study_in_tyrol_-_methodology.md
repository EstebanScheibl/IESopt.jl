_**Abstract --**_ The majority of district heating (DH) networks today are fueled by combustion processes based on fossil or biogenic fuels. For the decarbonization of DH networks various uncertainties regarding the future development of key factors, such as energy prices, need to be considered. Within the project “HeatHighway” a hypothetical inter-regional heat transfer network (HTN) in the region of the Inn valley in Tyrol, Austria was investigated.
